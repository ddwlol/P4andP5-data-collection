Without a strong support system, people can feel isolated and alone, which can exacerbate mental health issues, ease of information, technology, negativity on social media,The biggest factor that, in my opinion, harms the mental health of mothers specifically is the pressure to balance work and family responsibilities. Mothers are often expected to do it all, which can lead to feelings of overwhelm, exhaustion, and guilt, The biggest factor that, in my opinion, harms the mental health of fathers specifically is the pressure to be the breadwinner and provide for their family. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy, stress, and anxiety, The biggest factor that, in my opinion, harms the mental health of children specifically is the lack of quality time spent with their parents.

19, male, High SChool, social media, discussing mental health taboo In my experience the leading cause of widespread mental health epidemics relates to the growth of social media and the internet. People are finding more ways to be interconnected which can be great in many senses but also work out negatively. A lot of comparison and self-critique is done through social media. Individuals may see glamorous posts or others living their dream lives and feel a sense of emptiness or pity for themselves. This leads to a lot of self-doubt and anxiety about whether an individual is making the right choices in their life. Instead of focusing on improving themselves and being the best version of themselves it is a race to beat others and show off these accomplishments, The second-leading cause of this collective increase is that discussion of mental health can be considered as taboo in many cultures and a sign of weakness. Whereas it is easy to see a physical injury and how that can affect someone, mental injuries do not manifest in plain sight and can be much more difficult to empathize with. Repressing these emotions and not having an outlet to discuss certain issues can cause these symptoms to be worse. Bottling up emotions can result in long-term trauma , opportunities, family, lack of empathy, We live in a patriarchal society that is dominated by the decisions of men. Mothers are not represented in this system, Fathers are often expected to work hard and not show emotion. Their jobs are very thankless and a lot of the praise is given to mothers in the upbringing of a child , There is a disconnect between older and newer generations regarding mental health. A lot of parents have a mentality that mental health issues are not a real thing or can easily be toughed out. This leads to children being fearful of being seen as weak by disclosing their issues or just repressing their emotions altogether
